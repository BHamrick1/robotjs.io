# Getting Started

Install RobotJS using npm:

```
npm install robotjs
```
It's that easy! npm will download one of the prebuilt [binaries](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/releases/latest) for your OS.

You can get npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it installed.

If you need to build RobotJS, see the [building](#building) section. Instructions for [Electron](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Electron).
